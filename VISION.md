# The AHS Vision: Solving the Forensic Reconciliation Gap

Current GenAI is **Reactive**. AHS is **Agentic**.

## The Problem
Enterprises struggle with the "Context Stitching" problem—manually cross-referencing shifting regulatory requirements against massive legacy SOPs. Linear AI fails here because it loses nuances at the edge of the context window.

## The AHS Solution
By treating internal logic as a **Proprietary Data Moat**, AHS allows the agent's internal graph to grow more accurate with every interaction.

**Unit Economics:**
* **Old Way:** Cost = (Tokens per Document) × (Number of Queries)
* **AHS Way:** Cost = (Incremental Graph Update) + (Fixed Latent Retrieval)

## Market Opportunity

### Target Segments
1. **Enterprise Compliance** ($45B market)
   - Financial services regulatory reconciliation
   - Healthcare HIPAA/clinical guideline adherence
   - Manufacturing safety protocol management

2. **Legal Tech** ($28B market)
   - Contract analysis and conflict detection
   - Due diligence automation
   - Litigation support with traceable reasoning

3. **Supply Chain Intelligence** ($18B market)
   - Multi-vendor constraint optimization
   - Real-time logistics conflict resolution
   - Predictive disruption management

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Traditional RAG
- **Problem**: Context window decay, no memory persistence
- **AHS Advantage**: Living graph state with 100% traceability

### vs. LangChain/AutoGen
- **Problem**: Sequential agent loops, high token costs
- **AHS Advantage**: 70% latency reduction via speculative parallel retrieval

### vs. Vector Databases Alone
- **Problem**: No conflict resolution, no reasoning chains
- **AHS Advantage**: Skeptic subroutines + full provenance tracking
